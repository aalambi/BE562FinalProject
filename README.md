# Uncovering Amino Acid Patterns that Drive Antibody Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2

## Overview
This project investigates sequence patterns within the antibody CDRH3 region that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We use probabilistic sequence modeling and Bayesian inference to identify motifs and biochemical features that differentiate neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, and evaluate whether incorporating germline lineage context improves predictive performance.

This work was completed as a final project for BE562.

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages are imported within the notebook

### Data
The required `.csv` data file is included directly in this repository.

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone or download this repository locally.
2. Open the main `.ipynb` notebook titled `BE562_Final_Project_Aims_1_2_3_with_outputs.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Download the dataset file `CoV-AbDab_080224.csv` from this repository.
4. When prompted by the notebook, upload the `.csv` file using the file-upload cell (via the file explorer dialog).
5. Run the notebook cells in order from top to bottom.

All analyses, figures, and results shown in the repository are generated directly by the notebook.
